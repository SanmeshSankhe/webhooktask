# Webhook Server and Payload Decoder | Sanmesh Sankhe

## Overview

This project consists of two main components:

1. A **webhook server** built using Express.js that listens for incoming webhook requests.
2. A **Python script** that decodes a payload stored in a file (`file.txt`) and reconstructs it into a matrix format.

---

## Payload Decoder (Python)

The Python script reads a structured payload from `file.txt`, extracts position data, and constructs a matrix representation of the payload.
